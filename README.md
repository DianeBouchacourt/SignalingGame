# SignalingGame

This repository implements the study of "How agents see things: On visual representations in an emergent language game" (Bouchacourt and Baroni, EMNLP 2018). The paper is based on the signaling game of "Multi-agent cooperation and
the emergence of (natural) language." (Lazaridou et al., ICLR 2017) which is re-implemented here in Pytorch.
